# Learning Objectives

    - How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
    - How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
    - How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

    1. Simple Page and Page Size Parameters:
        Use page and page_size parameters to specify which portion of the dataset to retrieve.
        page represents the page number (starting at 1), and page_size is the number of items per page.

    2. Pagination with Hypermedia Metadata:
        Include hypermedia links in responses with data.
        Links specify navigation for next, previous, and total pages, enhancing client navigation.

    3. Pagination in a Deletion-Resilient Manner (Cursor-Based):
        Utilize unique identifiers (cursors) for dataset items.
        Retrieve the next page by providing the cursor of the last item from the previous page.
        This method adapts well to data changes and doesn't rely on item count or order.
