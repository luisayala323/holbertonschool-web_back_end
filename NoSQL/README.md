    1. What NoSQL means:
    NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." It refers to a category of databases that don't rely on traditional SQL for data management, making them suitable for handling diverse, unstructured data.

    2. Difference between SQL and NoSQL:
    SQL databases use structured tables and are best for complex queries, while NoSQL databases employ various data models, are more scalable, and are suited for simpler, read or write-heavy operations.

    3. What is ACID:
    ACID is an acronym representing key properties for ensuring the integrity of database transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

    4. What is document storage:
    Document storage is a NoSQL model where data is stored in semi-structured documents (e.g., JSON), providing flexibility in data organization.

    5. NoSQL types:
    NoSQL databases come in different types, including Document-based, Key-Value, Column-family, and Graph databases.

    6. Benefits of a NoSQL database:
    Benefits include scalability, flexibility, high availability, performance, and schema flexibility.

    7. How to query information from a NoSQL database:
    Query methods vary by NoSQL type, but typically, you use query languages or APIs to retrieve data based on document attributes or structure.

    8. How to insert/update/delete information from a NoSQL database:
    Use the database's APIs or query language to insert, update, or delete data as needed.

    9. How to use MongoDB:
    Install MongoDB, connect to it using a driver, define databases and collections, and use MongoDB's query language or APIs for data operations. Refer to MongoDB documentation and resources for specifics.
